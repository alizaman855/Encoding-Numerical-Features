# Encoding-Numerical-Features
There are two main methods to encode numerical features  1) Discritization 2) Binarization Discretization Discretization is the process of transforming the continous variables into discrete variables by creating a set of contiguous intervals that span teh range of the vriable's value. Discretization is also called binning, where bin is an alternative name of a interval.Why use bin?  1) To handel Outliers 2) To improve the value spread
