# Encoding-Numerical-Features
There are two main methods to encode numerical features  1) Discritization 2) Binarization 
Discretization is the process of transforming the continous variables into discrete variables by creating a set of contiguous intervals that span teh range of the vriable's value. Discretization is also called binning, where bin is an alternative name of a interval.Why use bin?  1) To handel Outliers 2) To improve the value spread 
Binarization is the process of transforming data features of any entity into vectors of binary numbers to make classifier algorithms more efficient. In a simple example, transforming an image's gray-scale from the 0-255 spectrum to a 0-1 spectrum is binarization.
